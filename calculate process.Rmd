```{r}
hmcd =read.csv("./homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() 
head(hmcd)
```
The data set has `r nrow(hmcd)` * ` r ncol(hmcd)` dimensions. Where uid describes the incident number, reported_date indicates the date and time, victim_last or victim first indicates the victim's name, and other data includes: race, age, gender, city, state, longitude, and latitude. And whether the incident was finally detected.
